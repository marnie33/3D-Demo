3D-Demo
=======

Using parallax to layer images and create a faux 3D effect

You will need these files to run this code:
jquery-ui.css
bootstrap.css
jquery-1.11.1.min.js
jquery-ui.js
jquery.parallax_1.0.js
jquery.event.frame.js
bootstrap.js

(outside of what is provided)

I am having difficulties figuring out how to upload the necessary image files for this to work, any advice would be appreciated. My Git level is novice, so be gentle!

Thanks!
